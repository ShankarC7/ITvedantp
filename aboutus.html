       <p>Antique Story was born out of a simple desire to learn and convey ancient narratives through art. We love going to unexpected places and finding beautiful stories and legends of the past, embedded into traditional arts and crafts. It is our dream to bring these stories to the present and ensure they are passed on into the future. 

During our travels across various Indian cities to locate and procure these collectibles, we found that the market for antiques was far from streamlined. It was a mammoth task not just to find genuine pieces, but also to connect to authentic art dealers. Whenever we came upon an original, real work of art, we started doing extensive research into each piece, talking to experts, collectors and historians. From our efforts to understand every creation through the stories and art forms behind it, emerged a determination to develop a comprehensive archive of designs from history.</p>
